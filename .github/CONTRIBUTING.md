## Raising issues

Please raise any bug reports on the issue tracker. Be sure to
search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were
trying to do and what went wrong. Provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

### Contributor License Agreement

In order for us to accept pull-requests, the contributor must first complete
a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Please see our [CLA repo](http://github.com/IBM-Swift/CLA) for more information.

This clarifies the intellectual property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a
